            <h1>What is Z Algorithm</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Z algorithm, an efficient string matching mechanism, operates in linear time, specifically O(n + m), to locate all occurrences of a given pattern within a string. 
                    This algorithm is built on the premise of the Z-array, which is the same length as the input string. Each element, Z[k], 
                    of this Z-array signifies the length of the longest matching substring that begins from the input string's corresponding index.</p>
                    <p>The procedure to construct the Z-array involves several steps. 
                        Initially, a new string is crafted by merging the pattern, a distinct character not found within the pattern or the text (represented by '$'), 
                        and the text itself. For instance, if the pattern is "abc" and the text is "abcabcabc", the assembled string would be "abc$abcabcabc".</p>
                    <p>Following this, the Z-array is initialized with all elements set to zero, and its length equivalent to the length of the newly formulated string. 
                        A left-to-right iteration is then performed on the new string. For every character, it's compared with the corresponding character in the prefix. 
                        If a match is found, the Z-value at that index is incremented. If not, the incrementation ceases.</p>
                    <p>In the processing of the Z-array, two major cases are encountered.</p> 
                    <p>Case 1: If k > r, which means there's no pattern substring that covers the character of the Z-array at index k (no Z-box 'leaps over' k). 
                        In this case, an attempt is made to match z-array[k] to z-array[0] and calculate the number of matching characters starting from index k.</p>
                    <p>Case 2: If k ≤ r, meaning there's a pattern substring that envelops the character of the Z-array at index k (a Z-box 'leaps over' k). 
                        Here, we examine the index k' = k - l in the Z-array, and two sub-cases can emerge:</p>
                    <p>a) If Z-array[k'] < B where B = r - k + 1, it is clear that no prefix substring begins at Z-array[k], as otherwise, Z-array[k'] would be larger. 
                        Hence, we can carry over our previously calculated values so Z-array[k] = Z-array[k'] and both l and r remain static.</p>
                    <p>b) If Z-array[k'] ≥ B where B = r - k + 1, it suggests that we can extend our Z-box at k, and so we start matching Z-array[k] to Z-array[0],
                         update r = k + j, where j represents the number of prefix characters that match starting at Z-array[k].</p>
                    <p>The completed Z-array is then used to identify all instances of the pattern in the text. 
                        A position in the Z-array with a value equivalent to the pattern's length is indicative of a match. For example, 
                        if the pattern is "abc" and the text is "abcabcabc", the resultant Z-array may look like [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], 
                        where the 3s represent matches of the pattern in the text.</p>
